# Creating a workspace in ros2

### Open a new terminal window, and create a new workspace. You can call it any name, but we will call it “ros_ws”
### Inside the workspace, we will create a source (i.e. src) directory. This is where your packages will go**.

    mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src


### Navigate to the workspace.

    cd ~/ros_ws/


### Let’s build the packages. Go to the root of the workspace.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions


### Build the packages

    colcon build

### Finally, we need to add the packages in this workspace to the current environment.

    sudo apt-get install gedit

### Open a new terminal window, and open your .bashrc file:

    gedit ~/.bashrc

### Add this line of code to the very bottom of the .bashrc file.

    source ~/ros_ws/install/setup.bash

### Save the file, and close it.
